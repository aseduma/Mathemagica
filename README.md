#
A Spring boot application that solve maths equations line by line, 
The application will allow students/learners to pass maths with flying colours,
less time for homeworks and assignments. The application will answer any question asked in the
mathematics classrooms.
#
The application will solve the problems of indivuals who are hindered by mathematics to get into colleges/work environment/advance to next grades due to their mathematics skills.
